# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
 One example of a GitHub repository for face mask detection using Convolutional Neural Networks is "chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection." This repository provides a Python implementation using TensorFlow and Keras for detecting face masks in images.

* get the image with a face
* apply the cascade classifire
* give me the rigion on instrect of the face, it give face location and face height and width.
* take the face and pass it to a pre train CNN
* it will give output probability of with the mask or without mask.

## Dataset

The dataset consisted of 1376 images, 690 face images with masks and 686 without masks. The original dataset is prepared by Prajna Bhandary and available at Github<br><br>
